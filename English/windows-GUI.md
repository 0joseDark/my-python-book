# Window Modules

This document describes the main Python modules for developing windows and graphical interfaces on Windows. Each module offers different functionalities and is suitable for different types of applications.

## Tkinter Module

**Tkinter** is Python's standard module for creating graphical interfaces. It is easy to learn and offers a wide variety of widgets.

### Features:
- Simple and easy-to-use interface
- Support for various types of widgets: buttons, labels, text boxes, etc.
- Ability to customize the appearance of windows

### Usage Example:

```python
import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Tkinter Example")

label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, Tkinter!")
label.pack()

root.mainloop()
```

label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, Tkinter!")
label.pack()

root.mainloop()
```

## PyQt5 Module

**PyQt5** is a set of Python bindings for the Qt libraries. It allows the development of complex graphical applications with a wide range of functionalities.

### Features:
- Support for modern and responsive graphical interfaces
- A wide range of advanced widgets
- Integration with databases, graphics, networks, and more

### Usage Example:

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel

app = QApplication([])

label = QLabel('Hello, PyQt5!')
label.show()

app.exec_()
```

## Kivy Module

**Kivy** is a Python library for developing multi-touch applications. It is particularly suitable for mobile and interactive applications.

### Features:
- Support for multi-touch gestures
- Compatible with Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS
- Flexible layouts and widgets

### Usage Example:

```python
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.label import Label

class MyApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return Label(text='Hello, Kivy!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyApp().run()
```

## wxPython Module

**wxPython** is a Python wrapper for the wxWidgets library, allowing the creation of native graphical interfaces.

### Features:
- Support for native system widgets
- Good documentation and active community
- Suitable for robust desktop applications

### Usage Example:

```python
import wx

app = wx.App(False)
frame = wx.Frame(None, wx.ID_ANY, "Hello, wxPython!")
frame.Show(True)
app.MainLoop()
```

## PySide2 Module

**PySide2** is the official open-source version of Python bindings for Qt. It is similar to PyQt5 but has a more permissive license.

### Features:
- Full support for all Qt functionalities
- Great for creating modern graphical interfaces
- Support for graphics, audio, networks, and more

### Usage Example:

```python
from PySide2.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel

app = QApplication([])
label = QLabel('Hello, PySide2!')
label.show()
app.exec_()
```

## DearPyGui Module

**DearPyGui** is a library for creating fast and simple graphical interfaces, using an API inspired by game engines.

### Features:
- Fast and lightweight
- Suitable for graphical tools and utilities
- Support for 2D graphics, flexible layouts, and events

### Usage Example:

```python
import dearpygui.dearpygui as dpg

dpg.create_context()

with dpg.window(label="DearPyGui Example"):
    dpg.add_text("Hello, DearPyGui!")
    dpg.add_button(label="Click Here")

dpg.create_viewport(title='Example', width=600, height=400)
dpg.setup_dearpygui()
dpg.show_viewport()
dpg.start_dearpygui()
dpg.destroy_context()
```

## Conclusion

These modules are the main options for developing graphical interfaces in Python on Windows. Each one has its particularities and is suitable for different types of projects, from simple applications to more complex and interactive interfaces.

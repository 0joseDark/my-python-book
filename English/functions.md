In Python, **functions** are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task. They make it easy to break down a program into smaller, manageable, and reusable sections. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function's name, parentheses (which can hold parameters), and a colon. The code inside the function is indented.

### Basic Structure of a Function
Here’s the general syntax for defining a function:
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code to execute
    return value  # optional, returns a result
```

### Example 1: A Simple Function
Here’s a basic function that adds two numbers:
```python
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result
```
To use this function, you would call it like so:
```python
sum = add(3, 5)
print(sum)  # Output: 8
```

### Parameters and Arguments
Functions can have parameters, which are like placeholders for values you provide when calling the function. In the example above, `a` and `b` are parameters. When you call `add(3, 5)`, `3` and `5` are the arguments, or values, passed to the parameters.

### Example 2: Function with Default Parameter
You can also set default values for parameters, which are used if no value is provided for them:
```python
def greet(name="Guest"):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
If you call `greet("Alice")`, it will print:
```plaintext
Hello, Alice!
```
But if you call `greet()` without providing a name, it will use the default value and print:
```plaintext
Hello, Guest!
```

### Example 3: Function with Multiple Returns
A function can also return multiple values as a tuple:
```python
def calculate(a, b):
    add = a + b
    subtract = a - b
    return add, subtract
```
When you call this function, you can capture both values:
```python
sum, difference = calculate(10, 5)
print(sum)       # Output: 15
print(difference) # Output: 5
```

### Example 4: Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are single-line functions created with the `lambda` keyword. They’re useful for simple operations:
```python
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
print(multiply(4, 3))  # Output: 12
```

### Why Use Functions?
Functions improve code readability, reduce redundancy, and make it easier to debug or update specific parts of a program. By defining a function once, you can call it multiple times throughout your code without rewriting it.

Here’s an overview of each of these topics within web development using Python:

### 11.1 Introduction to Flask
Flask is a lightweight, flexible Python web framework, ideal for beginners and small to medium-sized projects. It’s designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, allowing developers to create web applications quickly without the heavy scaffolding required by some other frameworks.

- **Example**: A basic Flask app
    ```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def home():
        return "Welcome to my Flask app!"

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```
    This code creates a basic web server that, when accessed, displays "Welcome to my Flask app!" at the root URL (`/`). 

### 11.2 Creating a RESTful API
RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources and are a popular way to enable communication between different parts of a system or with third-party applications. Flask has a module called Flask-RESTful that simplifies API creation.

- **Example**: A simple REST API for managing items
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

    app = Flask(__name__)
    items = []

    @app.route('/items', methods=['GET'])
    def get_items():
        return jsonify(items)

    @app.route('/items', methods=['POST'])
    def create_item():
        new_item = request.json
        items.append(new_item)
        return jsonify(new_item), 201

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```
    Here, `GET` retrieves all items, and `POST` allows new items to be added by sending JSON data. 

### 11.3 Web Development with Django
Django is a robust and feature-rich framework designed for larger applications, offering tools for handling databases, user authentication, and much more. It promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design, often requiring minimal setup to create a functional app.

- **Example**: A Django view rendering a template
    ```python
    # In views.py
    from django.shortcuts import render

    def home(request):
        return render(request, 'home.html', {'message': 'Welcome to Django!'})

    # In home.html template
    <html>
    <body>
        <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    Django's architecture separates models, views, and templates, allowing developers to organize code better and manage complex applications.

### 11.4 Authentication and Security
Both Flask and Django support various authentication methods (sessions, tokens, OAuth, etc.) and emphasize security practices such as avoiding SQL injection, using HTTPS, and protecting against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

- **Example (Flask authentication)**: Using `flask-login` for session management
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for
    from flask_login import LoginManager, UserMixin, login_user, login_required, logout_user

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.secret_key = 'supersecretkey'
    login_manager = LoginManager(app)

    class User(UserMixin):
        pass  # define user attributes here

    @login_manager.user_loader
    def load_user(user_id):
        # Load user from database (example: with SQLAlchemy)
        return User()

    @app.route('/login')
    def login():
        user = User()  # Simulate user login
        login_user(user)
        return redirect(url_for('protected'))

    @app.route('/protected')
    @login_required
    def protected():
        return "You are logged in!"

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```
    This example uses `flask-login` to manage sessions and protect routes. For Django, similar functionality can be implemented with built-in authentication views and decorators, like `login_required`.

Each of these elements builds a solid foundation in Python-based web development. Flask is excellent for lightweight applications and APIs, Django suits larger projects with built-in features, and both provide tools for handling security and authentication securely.

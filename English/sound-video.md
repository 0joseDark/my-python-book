Useful modules for sound, video and images in Python, which can be applied to your project:

### Sound Modules:

1. **Pygame**:
 - Pygame is a popular library for game development, which includes support for sound manipulation. It offers methods for playing sounds in formats such as `.wav` and `.mp3`.
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `pygame.mixer`: Load and play sounds.
 - `pygame.mixer.music`: Control music, including functions such as play, pause, stop.
 - **Project application**: Ideal for playing sound effects or soundtracks in games or interactive applications.

2. **PyDub**:
 - PyDub is a library for audio manipulation, with support for converting, splitting, and applying effects to sound files. Works with formats such as `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, among others.
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `AudioSegment.from_file()`: Loads audio files.
 - `AudioSegment.export()`: Exports audio to different formats.
 - **Application in the project**: Useful for converting audio between formats and manipulating sound tracks.

3. **Sounddevice**:
 - A simpler and more straightforward library for recording and playing audio.
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `sounddevice.play()`: Plays an audio array.
 - `sounddevice.rec()`: Records audio from the microphone.
 - **Project application**: Useful for projects that need quick sound capture or playback, such as simple recordings.

4. **PyAudio**:
 - PyAudio offers interfaces for real-time audio input and output.
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `pyaudio.Stream`: Records and plays audio in real time.
 - **Project application**: Recommended for use in projects that require streaming or real-time audio manipulation, such as voice recording and ambient sound capture.

5. **Wave**:
 - Wave is a native Python library for reading and writing `.wav` files.
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `wave.open()`: Opens `.wav` files.
 - **Application in the project**: Good option if you are only working with the `.wav` format and want something basic and direct.

### Video Modules:

1. **OpenCV (cv2)**:
 - One of the most powerful libraries for video and image manipulation, widely used in computer vision.
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `cv2.VideoCapture()`: Captures video from a camera or file.
 - `cv2.imshow()`: Displays the video in a window.
 - **Project application**: Ideal for capturing, processing and displaying videos in applications involving cameras or frame manipulation.

2. **MoviePy**:
 - MoviePy is a video editing library that allows you to cut, paste, resize and export videos.
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `VideoFileClip()`: Loads a video for editing.
 - `clip.subclip()`: Extracts a part of the video.
 - **Application in the project**: Good for manipulating videos, such as cutting, adding transitions or effects to videos.

3. **VLC**:
 - VLC can be used to play videos and streams, supporting virtually all video formats.
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `MediaPlayer()`: Controls video playback.
 - **Application in the project**: Excellent for playing videos of different formats and sources, such as streams or local files.

4. **FFmpeg (via `ffmpy` or `imageio-ffmpeg`)**:
 - FFmpeg is a powerful command-line tool for audio and video manipulation. In Python, you can integrate it via libraries like `ffmpy` or `imageio-ffmpeg`.
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `ffmpy.FFmpeg()`: Calls FFmpeg commands to convert or process videos.
 - **Application in the project**: Ideal for format conversion tasks and manipulation of video quality and resolution.

### Image Modules:

1. **Pillow**:
 - An image manipulation library that supports opening, modifying and saving files in various formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.).
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `Image.open()`: Opens an image.
 - `Image.save()`: Saves an image in different formats.
 - **In-project application**: Perfect for processing and modifying images before display or storage.

2. **Matplotlib**:
 - Although it is a graph visualization library, Matplotlib can be used to display and save images.
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `plt.imshow()`: Displays an image.
 - **Project application**: Good choice for quick visualizations and for integrating graphics with images.

3. **OpenCV (cv2)**:
 - OpenCV is also widely used for image manipulation in addition to videos.
 - **Useful functions**:
 - `cv2.imread()`: Reads an image from file.
 - `cv2.imwrite()`: Writes an image to a file.
 - **Project application**: Essential for projects that involve image processing, such as object detection or pixel manipulation.

### Integration for the project:
For your **games and media project ("mygame")**, you can combine sound modules (like Pygame or PyDub for sound effects), video
